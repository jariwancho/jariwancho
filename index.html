        <h2>Season Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Overall Performance:</strong>
Manchester United finished 15th in the Premier League table, their lowest finish in the league's history and their worst showing since they were last relegated from the top flight in 1974.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Managerial Changes:</strong>
Erik ten Hag left his role as Manchester United manager on 28 October 2024, departing the club after two-and-a-half years in charge. The poor start to the season contributed to his dismissal, with United having just 11 points after nine games of 2024-25.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Season Start:</strong>
The season began positively with Manchester United opening their Premier League campaign on 16 August 2024 with a 1–0 win over Fulham, with substitute and debutant Joshua Zirkzee scoring the only goal in the 87th minute.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Competition Participation:</strong>
The club participated in the Premier League, the FA Cup, the EFL Cup and the UEFA Champions League during what was their 138th season in history.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Overall Assessment:</strong>
Despite their final day victory against Aston Villa ending on a positive note, the season has been described as "an abhorrent campaign" with the Red Devils continuing to "sink to new depths in a post-Sir Alex Ferguson world."</p>
      <br>
      <p>This season represents one of the most disappointing campaigns in Manchester United's modern history, ultimately leading to significant changes in management and highlighting the club's ongoing struggles since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement.</p>
