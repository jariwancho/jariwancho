            <h2>Season Overview</h2>
            <p>The 2024-2025 season has been a challenging period for Manchester United, marked by significant changes in management and disappointing results. The season began under Erik ten Hag but saw a major transition when Ruben Amorim was appointed as head coach in November 2024.</p>
            
            <p>Manchester United opened their Premier League campaign with optimism, securing a 1-0 victory over Fulham on August 16, 2024, with debutant Joshua Zirkzee scoring the winning goal in the 87th minute. However, the season has been characterized by inconsistent performances and poor league positioning.</p>

            <h3>Performance Under Ruben Amorim</h3>
            <p>Since Amorim's appointment in November 2024, Manchester United's performance has been concerning. The team has accumulated fewer points than several mid-table clubs including Crystal Palace, West Ham, Everton, and Brentford during this period.</p>
